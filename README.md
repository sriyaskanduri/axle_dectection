# Axle Detection

## 📌 Overview
This project focuses on axle detection using computer vision techniques. It processes images or video frames to detect axles in vehicles, which can be useful for applications such as traffic monitoring, vehicle classification, and automated inspections.

## 🚀 Features
- **Axle Detection**: Identifies and counts axles in vehicle images.
- **Image Processing**: Uses computer vision techniques for feature extraction.
- **Machine Learning Integration**: Implements deep learning models for accurate detection.
- **Real-time Processing**: Supports live video stream analysis.

## 🛠️ Requirements
Ensure you have the following dependencies installed:

```bash
pip install opencv-python numpy matplotlib tensorflow torch
```

Or install all dependencies from `requirements.txt`:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## 🔧 Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-repo/axle-detection.git
   cd axle-detection
   ```
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 📌 Usage
Run the Jupyter Notebook in Google Colab:
1. Open `axle_detection.ipynb` in Google Colab.
2. Upload your test images/videos.
3. Run the provided code cells to detect axles.

Alternatively, run locally:
```bash
jupyter notebook axle_detection.ipynb
```

## 📊 Results
The model will highlight detected axles and provide analysis, including axle count and possible classification.

## 🛠️ Future Improvements
- Enhance accuracy with additional datasets.
- Optimize real-time performance.
- Deploy as a web application using Streamlit or Flask.
